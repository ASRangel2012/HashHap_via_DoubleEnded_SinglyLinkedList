# HashHap via DoubleEnded SinglyLinked Lists Implementation

Advanced Java Hash Tables implementation with separate chaining to handle collisions.
 - two nested classes:
    - private class Node  
    - public class DoubleEndedSinglyLinkedList.
      
The private node class creates the object that will be stored in the hashTable and provides the nextNode for the singly linked list. 
The public class DoubleEndendSinglyLinkedList allows the user to access to the head and tail nodes and specific methods.
