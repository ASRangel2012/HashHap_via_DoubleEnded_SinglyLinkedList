HashHap_via_DoubleEnded_SinglyLinkedList
Hash Table Implementation with double-ended singly linked lists using Separate Chaining to handle collisions
The HashTable_via_DoubleEnded_SinglyLinkedList class has two nested classes, private class Node and class DoubleEndedSinglyLinkedList.
The private node class creates the object that will be stored in the hashTable and provides the nextNode for the singly linked list. 
The public class DoubleEndendSinglyLinkedList allows the user to access to the head and tail nodes and specific methods.
